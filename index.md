What is the terminal? Why is it an important tool for a web developer?
The terminal is a program where you can type in commands to complete different actions. The terminal can be used to stay organized.
It is helpful for creating and navigating through files.

For you, what are some important built-in commands to know. What do they do, and why are they important? (At least 5)
I know that cd is probably the most basic command, but as I am still getting used to using the terminal, this one is important. Cd, or change directory is how you switch which file you are working in.
Man - shows a manual with all of the commands, unless your system uses containers
Pwd - print working directory. This will have the output of the path to the current working directory.
mkdir - make directory creates a new directory
ls - stands for list and it returns the output of a list of the content in a directory

What is the root?
Root is the name of the user or owner of the directory. The root has access to actions in the directory through the terminal. 

What is the path?
The path defines the location of a file or directory. The path of a file is used to run commands on that file. 
PATH is the list of directories that can and will be searched when you type in a command in the terminal. 

What is the present working directory?
The present working directory is the current directory where work is being done. If you run a command, it will be run on the current directory.
This helps stay organized using the terminal so that commands are not run in unwanted directories.

What is the bin? How does it work?
Bin is short for binaries. It contains commands that can be used by not only the admin but also by any user. 
Which ls shows where the bin sits

Write about at least two new things you have personally learned about the command line.
An evironmental variable is a variable stored in your own files that can be seen by all other files. 
There are two things named path and root. 
A container is a file system object that wraps a process
ss is a secure socket tool
curl transfers a url
man -k is helpful to look for something specific in the manual
